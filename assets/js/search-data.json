If you are completely new to C++ / C, please talk to us so we can direct you to more resources. . C++ is a high level programming language. A computer’s CPU is incapable of speaking C++. The limited set of instructions that a CPU can understand directly is called machine code. . Programs written in high level languages must be translated into machine code before they can be run. There are two primary ways this is done: compiling and interpreting. C++ is a compiled language, meaning that it has to be compiled. . . Hello world . It’s not a programming language if doesn’t allow to print “Hello World”. The very first C++ program that we will look at is one that prints this simple text to the terminal. . Create a new file called hello.cpp (try to use the terminal for this), and write the following code: . #include &lt;iostream&gt; int main(){ std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello World from VNAV 2020! n&quot;; return 0; } . Let’s have a closer look to the code. On the first line, we include the iostream header file. Header files are mechanisms in C++ through which definitions of functions and classes are exposed to different programs. The first character is the # symbol, which is a marks the statement to the preprocessor. Each time you start your compiler, the preprocessor reads through the source code, looking for lines that begin with the pound symbol (#), and acts on those lines before the compiler runs. The angle brackets around the filename tell the preprocessor to look in all the usual places for this file. If your compiler is set up correctly, the angle brackets will cause the preprocessor to look for the file iostream.h in the directory that holds all the header files in your system. Note that the header file name does not have any extension, this is true for all of the Standard Library header files. The header iostream (Input-Output-Stream) is used by std::cout, which assists with writing to the screen (console output). . Line 3 begins the actual program with a function named int main(). Every C++ program has a main() function, it in facts marks the entry point of the program. When the program starts, main() is called by the operating system. Like all functions, the main must state what kind of value it will return. The return value type for main() in int, which means that this function will a status code. All ANSI-compliant programs declare main() to return an int. This value is “returned” to the operating system when your program completes. Some programmers signal an error by returning the value 1 and success with 0. . All blocks begin with an opening brace ({) and end with a closing brace (}). The main part of our program happen on line 4. The object std::cout is used to print a message to the standard output (i.e. the terminal), you will use the std::cout a lot. Here’s how std::cout is used: type the word std::cout, followed by the output redirection operator (&lt;&lt;). Whatever follows the output redirection operator is written to the screen. If you want a string of characters written, be sure to enclose them in double quotes (&quot;). . The final two characters, n, tell cout to put a new line after the words Hello World! This special code is explained in detail when cout is discussed on Day 17. . Keep in mind. . Around the web you will commonly find using namespace std; to avoid std::. Setting the global namespace is a pretty bad practice, try to avoid it. . To run this program, we must first compile it using a C++. We will be using the C++ compiler in the GNU Compiler Collection. In your terminal run . g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -pedantic -o hello hello.cpp . we are saying to the compiler to enable the C++11 standard (-std=c++11), report all warnings (-Wall) and to strictly adhere to the standard (-pedantic). The output file will be called hello. . If everything works out fine (and it should) you can run your first C++ application! . $ ./hello Hello World from VNAV 2020! . Standard vector . Let’s move to something more, the standard vector. Vector is a template class that implements a variable length array. It allows the same natural syntax that is used with plain arrays but offers a series of services that free the C++ programmer from taking care of the allocated memory and help operating consistently on the contained objects. . The first step using vector is to include the appropriate header: . #include &lt;vector&gt; . There are multiple ways to initialize a vector, the simplest is the following: . std::vector&lt;T&gt; vect; . This widely used notation, T stands for any data type, built-in, or user-defined class. The vector will store the Ts in a contiguous memory area that it will handle for us, and let us access the individual T simply by writing vect[0], vect[1], and so on, exactly like we would do for a C-style array. . Another very useful way to initialize it is the following . std::vector&lt;T&gt; histo(int size, T initial_value); . In this case we are saying to create a vector of size-elements, each initialized with the value initial_value. . Keep in mind. . You can access the vector elements with the square brackets but this will not check if the index is out of bound, it is better to use the at method, e.g. v.at(0) since it will throw an exception if the index is out of bound. . If we do not pre-initialize the vector we must add elements one by one. To add at the end of the vector we can use the push_back(T elem) method. For example we can declare a vector of integers and fill it with 5 random number in the interval 0-99: . // Create a vector containing integers std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec; // Fill the vector with random number in [0, 99] for (auto i = 1; i &lt;= 5; ++i){ vec.push_back(rand() % 100); } . The current size of the vector can be retrieved with the method size() . std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Vector size: &quot; &lt;&lt; vec.size() &lt;&lt; std::endl; . The information can be used to access all the elements of the vector: . for(int i = 1; i &lt; vec.size(); ++i){ std::cout &lt;&lt; vec.at(i) &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;; } . We could have done it in a slight better way (exploiting C++11 feature) using the ranged-based for loops: . for (auto &amp;elem: vec){ std::cout &lt;&lt; elem &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;; } . Note two important things: . We used the keyword auto. For variables, specifies that the type of the variable that is being declared will be automatically deduced. Use it whenever it is clear to understand the type since it allows several optimization from the compiler. | We used the operator &amp; before the name of the variable. This marks the variable as reference to the original value and therefore avoids the copy of the element. | The complete code that declare, initialize and print a vector is listed below . #include &lt;cstdlib&gt; // required for rand #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;vector&gt; int main(){ // initialize rand with constant seed for reproducibility std::srand(314159); // Create a vector containing integers std::vector&lt;int&gt; vec; // Fill the vector with random number in [0, 99] for (auto i = 1; i &lt;= 5; ++i) vec.push_back(rand() % 100); // Print number of elements in the vector to screen std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Vector size: &quot; &lt;&lt; vec.size() &lt;&lt; std::endl; // Print all elements to screen std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Vector elements: &quot;; for (auto &amp;elem: vec) std::cout &lt;&lt; elem &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot;; std::cout &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } . If you compile and run this code you will see something like . $ ./ex1 Vector size: 5 Vector elements: 19 10 47 39 39 . Classes . C++ is an object-oriented programming language. The main entity of objects are classes. You can think of a class like it was a new data type (like int or double) containing several variables (of different types, called members) and some functions (called methods). . For example you can think to a new type called Circle. A circle has a radius (an intrinsic property), and several functions apply to a circle like computing the circumference and the area. . Declaring a class is very easy . class Circle{}; . With the simple statement we create a class named Circle. Being a new data type we can instantiate a class in the same way we instantiate an integer . Circle c; . The class so far is not very useful, it does not contain any members or methods. To add the member radius we need to change the declaration of the class . class Circle{ double radius; } . Now we have a member but if you try to modify the value you will discover that you cannot: this happens because by default members are declared private, so nobody expect the class methods can change its value. To set the value we need a class constructor. The class constructor is simply a method (without return value) with the same name of the class . class Circle{ double radius; public: Circle(double rad){ radius = rad; } } . As you see now we declared the constructor under the public keyword. It is called access specifier and says who can access members and methods. . Moreover. . We can also declare a member to be public, and in this case it would have been a good idea. In strict object-oriented programming this is usually avoided because if we allow the user to directly change the class properties we lose the opportunity to perform any book-keeping on the class itself (e.g. maybe we have to update other properties when we change the radius of the circle). . Using the same approach of the constructor we can add two more methods: double circumference() and double area() . #include &lt;cmath&gt; // required for pow and M_PI #include &lt;iostream&gt; class Circle{ double radius; public: Circle(double r) { radius = r; } double circumference(){ return 2*M_PI*radius; } double area(){ return M_PI*std::pow(radius,2); } }; int main(){ Circle circ(3); std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Circumference: &quot; &lt;&lt; circ.circumference() &lt;&lt; std::endl; std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Area: &quot; &lt;&lt; circ.area() &lt;&lt; std::endl; return 0; } . If you compile and run the code above, you should see something like: . $ ./ex2 Circumference: 18.8496 Area: 28.2743 . Eigen . Now that we’ve covered some of the basics syntax of C++, it’s time to take a look at some of the existing libraries out there that will help us throughout this course. Eigen, a fast header-only linear algebra library, is the one we will try out right now. To install Eigen, it is very simple: . sudo apt install libeigen3-dev . What this command does is that it will download all relevant Eigen header files to a folder that will be searched by compilers. In the case of Ubuntu, Eigen’s header files will be downloaded to /usr/include/eigen3 or /usr/local/include/eigen3. . Here’s an example from Eigen’s documentation that will get you started: . #include &lt;iostream&gt; #include &lt;Eigen/Dense&gt; int main() { Eigen::MatrixXd m(2,2); m(0,0) = 3; m(1,0) = 2.5; m(0,1) = -1; m(1,1) = m(1,0) + m(0,1); std::cout &lt;&lt; m &lt;&lt; std::endl; } . Let’s take a look at this example line-by-line. First, we include the &lt;iostream&gt; header for printing to our terminal, which should be familiar to you now. Next, we include the &lt;Eigen/Dense&gt; header, which defines member functions and types that work with dense matrices. &lt;Eigen/Dense&gt; is one of the many modules Eigen provides. If you are interested in learning more, please check out this page. . In the main function, we first declare a variable called m of type Eigen::MatrixXd. The Eigen:: part represents the namespace in which Eigen’s functions and types live. MatrixXd represents a matrix of arbitrary size (notice the X in MaxtriXd), and each entry in the matrix is of type double (hence the d in MatrixXd). We use MatrixXd’s constructor to set the matrix to be 2-by-2. We then use the () operator to set all entries. As usual in computer science, the index of the first entry is 0, instead of 1. The final line in the main function prints the matrix to the standard output stream. . To compile it, assuming it’s saved in a file named eigen-example.cpp, you simply need to run: . g++ -o eigen-example eigen-example.cpp . You should see the following after executing the code above: . $ ./eigen-example 3 -1 2.5 1.5 . Where to go now .

This exercise will help you to understand how to perform transformation between different rotation representations using ROS. In addition, you will gain experience of reading through a documentation in order to find what you need. . A. Message vs. tf . In ROS, there are two commonly used datatypes for quaternions. One is geometry_msgs::Quaternion and the other is tf2::Quaternion. Based on the documentation for tf2 and its package listing page, answer the following questions in a text file called deliverable_1.txt: .

Hint: the drag force introduced above is an additional term in the system’s dynamics, which the controller could compensate for explicitly… | . Team . Trajectory tracking for UAVs . In this section, we are going to implement the geometric controller discussed in class on a simulated drone. . Getting the codebase . First, let us install some prerequisites. In a terminal, run: . sudo apt install ros-melodic-mav-msgs ros-melodic-ackermann-msgs . Consistently with the folder structure introduced in previous assignments, we will navigate to our existing clone of the VNAV Labs repository and pull the latest updates: . # change the folder name according to your setup cd ~/labs git pull . In ~/labs/lab_3 we now have the tesse_ros_bridge and the controller_pkg folders, which are both ROS packages. Let us copy these folders in our VNAV workspace and build the workspace as follows: . cp -r ~/labs/lab_3/. ~/vnav_ws/src cd ~/vnav_ws . In your src folder, you should see three folders: catkin_simple, controller_pkg and tesse-ros-bridge. Then, we need install some Python dependencies: . cd ~/vnav_ws/src/tesse-ros-bridge/tesse-interface pip install -r requirements.txt # Dependencies pip install . . At this point, you can both keep your lab 2 code or remove all the folders related to the previous labs. Either way, you need to compile the new code. . catkin build source devel/setup.bash . After doing so, please proceed here to download the binary executable for the simulator we are going to use for lab 3. Unzip the file, put the folder in ~/vnav-builds, and run the following commands: . cd ~/vnav-builds/vnav-2020-lab3/ chmod +x vnav-2020-lab3.x86_64 . This will make sure you can run the executable in the command line. . Launching the TESSE simulator with ROS bridge . In a terminal window, run this command to start the simulator: . cd ~/vnav-builds/vnav-2020-lab3/ ./vnav-2020-lab3.x86_64 . One the simulator starts, you should see the unity simulator (fig. below). . . In the simulator, you can: . press W to turn on all propellers; | press R to respawn the quadrotor at the initial location. | . Note that you can resize the window to help with debugging later on. . Once the workspace has been compiled successfully, with your workspace sourced execute: . # make sure to source devel/setup.bash! roslaunch tesse_ros_bridge tesse_quadrotor_bridge.launch . This launches two ROS nodes: tesse_ros_brige and quadrotor_control_interface. The former receives state messages from our simulator and publishes them in a few ROS topics, and the latter listens to our controller node and sends the propeller commands to our simulator. To visualize the state of our quadrotor, we will use rviz. Run the following command to load our rviz preset: . cd ~/vnav_ws/src/controller_pkg rviz -d rviz/lab3.rviz . You should see a screen similar to this: . . A few highlights: . the purple upward arrow corresponds to the IMU message; | the base_link_gt axes correspond to the body frame of the quadrotor; | the world axes correspond to the world frame in ROS. | . Implement the controller . From the previous section, you must have noticed that the drone is stationary. Unsurprisingly, this happens because the UAV is not receiving any control inputs. In this section, you will be precisely asked to take care of it! . Given four propeller speeds, the simulator propagates forward the UAV dynamics and outputs the current state of the robot. It is your job now to provide the propeller speeds based on the current state of the robot (from the simulator) and a desired one (from a trajectory generator). This problem is extensively described in the geometric controller paper 1, where the authors introduce an almost-globally convergent geometric controller for a quadrotor, also outlined in class. We will ask you to read the paper thoroughly and implement this controller in ROS. . For the purposes of this lab, the trajectory generator is given by the traj_publisher node, which outputs a time-varying desired state along a hard-coded circular trajectory. The navigation stack (almost) implemented in our codebase has the architecture shown below: . . where the ROS nodes are highlighted as vertices in the graph and the ROS topic names are reported on the edges. . In particular: . /desired_state is of type trajectory_msgs/MultiDOFJointTrajectoryPoint and has the following fields: transforms - type geometry_msgs/Transform[]: translation: a 3D vector with the desired position of the c.o.m. in the world frame | rotation: a quaternion rapresenting a rotation (in our case will be only a yaw component) | . | velocities - type geometry_msgs/Twist[]: linear: a 3D vector with the desired velocity of c.o.m. in world frame | angular: we will ignore this field as it is not used by the controller | . | accelerations - type geometry_msgs/Twist[]: linear: a 3d vector with the desired acceleration of c.o.m. in world frame | angular: we will ignore this field as it is not used by the controller | . | . | /current_state is of type nav_msgs/Odometry with the relevant fields: pose.pose - type geometry_msgs/Pose: position: a 3d vector with the current position of the c.o.m. in the world frame | orientation: a quaternion representing the current orientation of the UAV | . | twist.twist - type geometry_msgs/Twist: linear: a 3d vector with the current velocity of c.o.m. in the world frame | angular: a 3d vector with the current angular velocity in the world frame | . | . | /rotor_speed_cmds is of type mav_msgs/Actuators and it contains the relevant field: angular_velocities - type float64[], containing the desired speeds of the propellers. | . | . Simulator conventions . In the picture below, we illustrate the conventions used in unity simulator for the propeller speeds and their positions in the body frame. Please look carefully as this will help you build the correct wrench-to-controls matrix (F2W) in the coding assignment . . Note that . as in most research papers, we assume that, for $ omega_i &gt; 0$, all the propellers produce an upward force (lift). This is consistent with the first row of the matrix in eq. (6.9) on the lecture notes. While this might be confusing at first, note that on real quadrotors the motors are configured to rotate in different directions: two counter-clockwise (CCW), and two clockwise (CW). This configuration is necessary so that our quadrotor will be stable in its yaw direction. There are also two sets of propellers: one set for CCW motors, and another set for CW motors (both will produce upward force if mounted appropriately). See this video for an example. | in the figure, we show the positive spinning directions for the propellers (blue) and the resulting direction of the yaw torques generated by aerodynamic drag. For example: propeller 1’s angular velocity $ omega_1$ is considered positive when propeller 1 spins clockwise (as seen from top), which in turn produces a counter-clockwise drag torque $ tau_{ text{drag}_1}$. The sign of the drag torque is determined by applying right-hand rule: positive for counter-clockwise, and negative for clockwise. | the spinning directions are different from the paper and the lecture notes. The expression $ tau_{ text{drag}}^i = (-1)^i c_d , omega_i | omega_i |$ implies that the drag on propeller 1 produces a negative (clockwise) yaw torque instead, for $ omega_1$. However, the above convention is acceptable: propellers are mounted differently in the simulated quadrotor! | the propeller speeds need to be provided in radians per second (rad/s), NOT in rpm. Initially, it will be tempting to go for the latter, as it will make the drone move more easily (control inputs get bigger), however, it will hurt you in the long run. | . Before proceeding, keep in mind that there are a number of caveats that will make the math in your code slightly different from the one found in the paper. The main differences can be summarized as follows: . Reference frames. The paper and your code use different conventions for coordinate frames. Please refer to the figure and pay attention to the two main facts summarized below. . . In the paper, the $z$-axes - both in the world and body frames - are downwards, while ROS has them pointing upwards. This affects the signs of $b_{3_d}$ in equation (12), as well as gravity and aerodynamic forces in equations (12), (15), (16). (equation numbers refer to the paper 1). | In the paper, the $x$-body axis is along a propeller arm, while we prefer having it at 45° between two propellers. This will require some thought on your end when converting the total desired force + torques (wrench) into the desired propeller speeds. In other words, you have to change equation (1) from the paper. For this step, refer to equation (6.9) in the lecture notes! | Aerodynamic coefficients. In the paper, equation (1), the quantity $c_{ tau f}$ relates directly the yaw torque with the lift produced by a propeller. In contrast, we prefer using the lift and drag coefficients $c_f$ and $c_d$, which have a clearer physical interpretation. Consider the relation $c_{ tau f}=c_d/c_f$ between these coefficients. . Deliverable 3 - Geometric controller for the UAV (50 pts) . After reading the reference 1 - thoroughly - get together with your teammates and open the source file controller_node.cpp. In this file, you will find detailed instructions to fill in the missing parts and make your quadrotor fly! To have full credits for this part of the lab, your team needs to complete the following: . Implement all missing parts in controller_node.cpp and ensure everything compiles. | Tune parameters so that the quadrotor achieves stable circular trajectory. | A video showing the quadrotor completing one round of the circular trajectory in rviz (can either be a screen capture, or a video shot using your phone). Please upload the video onto either Google drive or Dropbox, generate a publicly viewable link, and put the link in a text file called rviz_drone_flight.txt in your repo. | . How to test . Once you are ready to compile your code, run: . catkin build . from the folder ~/vnav_ws. . To try out your code, launch the simulator. Additionally, run your controller by typing, in a separate terminal: . roslaunch controller_pkg traj_tracking.launch . Depending on your focus - and degree of luck - it will take multiple attempts to have a stable and smooth controller and multiple iterations of parameter tuning. That’s normal! . As a suggestion, you could start by testing a stationary waypoint, before moving to the circular trajectory. This is possible by switching the STATIC_POSE flag to 1 in controller_pkg/src/traj_publisher.cpp. Also, you should use rviz to visually compare the desired and the current poses. . Tuning tips . First of all, look closely at the equations and see what are the gain parameters directly affecting. Which one affects the yaw? Which one affects the speed? Which one affects the position? Doing so will give you a rough idea on what to do for tuning. . To provide a more graphical/qualitative understanding, here are some typical situations that you might encounter: . komega is too high: . kr is too low: . kv is too low: . NOTE: The specific gain parameters may differ across different computers. . What to expect . If your controller is working reasonably well we expect to see something like this: . . Note: it is totally fine if the drone does a rapid maneuver to start tracking the circle as soon as you run the controller node. . Good luck! . References . Lee, Taeyoung, Melvin Leoky, N.

Copy this folder in your VNAV workspace and build the workspace as follows: . cp -r ~/labs/lab2/two_drones_pkg ~/vnav_ws/src . Building the code . Building the code is as easy as running: . catkin build . Now that you built the code you see that catkin added a bunch of new folders. In order to use our workspace, we need to make ROS aware of all the components by sourcing the corresponding environment. This is done by running the following in every single terminal where you intend to use the workspace: . source devel/setup.bash . For the rest of the assignment, we assume that you are performing this operation whenever necessary. . A two-drone scenario . In this part, we are going to work with 3D Rigid Transformations and with tf, a basic tool provided by ROS to keep track of multiple coordinate frames over time. . The static scenario and rViz . To get started, let’s go back to the VNAV workspace and bring up the two-drones static scenario. In this environment, we have two aerial vehicles, AV1 [blue] and AV2 [red] that are not moving, but it serves as a good starting point! With the VNAV workspace sourced in a terminal, run: . roslaunch two_drones_pkg two_drones.launch static:=True . You should see the following window, which shows the initial positions of the two AVs. . . This window is rViz, the mighty ROS visualizer! Just like most processes in the ROS ecosystem, rViz is a ROS node. Like all other nodes, rViz can subscribe to ROS topics. However, its specialty is converting them into graphics on your screen to display the state of your robotic system. . As a first experience with rViz, let us: . Add the visualization of tf. In the Displays panel, click Add, select the By display type Tab in the pop-up and finally select “TF” and confirm with Ok. You should see all the reference frames, with names and their axes represented in red (x), green (y) and blue (z). | Save the configuration file. So that we don’t have to repeat the step above every time we launch it! Hit CTRL + s or select File &gt; Save Config. | . Other published topics can be added to the visualizer in a similar way. . Problem formulation . We consider the scenario illustrated in the picture below, where two aerial vehicles, AV1 [blue] and AV2 [red] are following different trajectories: a circle and an arc of parabola, respectively. In the scene, we have highlighted the following elements: . The world frame $(x_w, y_w, z_w)$ | The AV1 body frame, centered in $O_1$ with axes $(x_1,y_1,z_1)$ | The origin of AV2, denoted with $O_2$ | . . Positions . In the world frame, AV1 and AV2’s origins are given by: . $o_1^w = [ text{cos}(t), text{sin}(t), 0]^T$, and | $o_2^w = [ text{sin}(t), 0, text{cos}(2t)]^T$, | . where $t$ denotes time. . Orientations . We will make the following simplifying assumptions: . AV1’s reference frame is such that $y_1$ stays tangent to AV1’s trajectory for all $t$ and $z_1$ is parallel to $z_w$ for all $t$ (i.e., equivalently, roll = pitch = 0, yaw = $t$) | AV2’s reference frame moves with pure translation and we can assume that its axes are parallel to the world axes for all times $t$ | . Notes . Given the dynamics of a quadrotor, these motions are dynamically infeasible. However, for the purpose of this lab, we disregard this fact and focus on the study of rigid transformations | To make the math of this problem more interesting, we chose the $y_1$ axis to point in the direction of motion of the drone. However, do not forget that the standard convention is that $x_1$ should point forward! | . In the sequel, we reproduce the above scenario in ROS and study the trajectory of AV2 relative to AV1’s coordinate frame. . Basic ROS commands . 📨 Deliverable 1 - Nodes, topics, launch files (10 pts) . With the roslaunch command above we have spawned a number of ROS nodes at the same time. Using your knowledge of ROS, answer the following questions: . List the nodes running in the two-drone static scenario. Hint: you can directly inspect the launch file or get some help from rqt_graph. You will notice that rViz is initially not shown in it but you can uncheck the Debug option for a full picture, feel free to ignore all /rosout nodes and topics and /rqt_gui_py_* that may appear | . | How could you run the two-drone static scenario without using the roslaunch command? List the commands that you would have to execute, in separate terminals, to achieve the same result. Hint: rosrun [...], try things out before finalizing your answer! | . | List the topics that each node publishes / subscribes to. What nodes are responsible for publishing the av1, av2, frames? Which topic causes rViz to plot the drone meshes? Hint: uncheck items on the left pane in rViz until the meshes disappear, then check what node is publishing the corresponding topic | . | What changes if we omit static:=True? Why? Hint: check out and briefly explain the if and unless keywords in the launch file | . | Let’s make things move! Publishing the transforms using tf . After exploring the static scenario, it’s time to implement the motions described in the problem formulation section and visualize them in rViz. With the editor of your choice, open frames_publisher_node.cpp in the src folder of two_drones_pkg. In this file, we provide a basic structure of a ROS node. . Some Context . Please take your time to familiarize with this code before modifying it. Although not mandatory, the pattern found in it is a very common way to implement ROS nodes: . The node’s source code is encapsulated into a class, FramesPublisherNode (line 6), which keeps a nodeHandle as a private member. | In the constructor of the class (lines 14 to 19), one performs operations that need to be executed only once upon startup (e.g. typically, initializing subscribers and publishers), | Using a Timer (lines 10 and 17), the onPublish() method is called periodically - at a 50Hz - and all the operations within it are performed ad libitum, | In the body of main() (towards the end of the file): the node is registered with ros::init(...) | an instance of the node class is created | a blocking call to ros::spin() is issued, which starts ROS’s main loop. | . | . 📨 Deliverable 2 - Publishing transforms (30 pts) . In frames_publisher_node.cpp, follow the instructions in the comments and fill in the missing code. Your objective is to populate the provided AV1World and AV2World variables to match the motions described in the problem formulation. These objects are instances of the tf::transform class, which is ROS jargon for a homogeneous transformation matrix. . Keep in mind. . Ensure that the orientation of the AV1 frame is in accordance with the assumptions made in the problem formulation, as this is of crucial importance for the final result! . How to test . Once you are ready to compile your code, run: . catkin build . from the workspace folder ~/vnav_ws. . To try out your code, launch the two-drone scenario in non-static mode, i.e. run: . roslaunch two_drones_pkg two_drones.launch . What to expect . You should finally see the drones moving! Check that the trajectories reflect those illustrated in the figure in the problem formulation. . . Changing the rViz fixed reference frame. . As mentioned, we are interested in the motion of AV2 relative to AV1’s reference frame. In the Displays panel (left, by default), under the Global Options section, rViz offers the possibility to change the Fixed Frame to any frame published in tf. Try it out yourself and change “world” into “av1” by typing in the corresponding field. From this perspective, AV1 appears static, the world frame spins around its $z$ axis and AV2 seems to be following a closed-curve trajectory. . 📨 Deliverable 3 - Looking up a transform (30 pts) . In plots_publisher_node.cpp, follow the instructions in the comments and fill in the missing code. Your objective is to populate the provided object, transform, with the relative transform between two given frames with names ref_frame and dest_frame. . Compile your code and try it out as previously explained. . What to expect . You should eventually see three trajectories, namely: . AV1’s trajectory [blue, solid] in the world frame (circle on the x-y plane) | AV2’s trajectory [red, solid] in the world frame (parabola on the z-x plane) | The trajectory of AV2 in AV1’s frame [red, dashed]. You should now have a strong hunch that this curve is a ellipse on a “slanted” plane! | . Note: if the results you are observing do not seem to make sense, try swapping ref_frame and dest_frame when interrogating tf. . Let’s do some math . So far, we have used ROS and tf to get a visual understanding of the motion of AV2 relative to AV1’s body frame. In this section, you are asked to use your knowledge about homogeneous transformations and study the relative trajectory explicitly. . The visualization we have built should provide you with great guidance while working out the following questions. Since this exercise is designed for you to familiarize with the math of 3D transformations, we require that you explicitly write down all the homogeneous transformation matrices used in the process and precisely outline the logic and algebraic steps taken. . 📨 Deliverable 4 - Mathematical derivations (25 pts) . In the problem formulation, we mentioned that AV2’s trajectory is an arc of parabola in the $x$-$z$ plane of the world frame. Can you prove this statement? Hint: $cos(2t)$ can be written as… | . | Compute $o_2^1(t)$, i.e., the position of AV2 relative to AV1’s body frame as a function of $t$. Hint: write down the homogeneous transformations and compose them accordingly… | . | Show that $o_2^1(t)$ describes a planar curve and find the equation of its plane $ Pi$. Hint: find a linear relation between $z_2^1$ and $y_2^1$ | . | Rewrite the above trajectory explicitly using a 2D frame of reference $(x_p, y_p)$ on the plane found before. Try to ensure that the curve is centered at the origin of this 2D frame and that $x_p$, $y_p$ are axes of symmetry for the curve. Hints: | .  i) center the new 2D frame in $p^1= (-1,-1/2,0)$, these coordinates are in AV1’s frame |  ii) start with a 3D reference frame centered in p with axes $(x_p, y_p, z_p)$, compute $o_2^p(t)$ |  iii) make sure that the $z$ component vanishes after the change of coordinates | | Using the expression of $o_2^p(t)$, prove that the trajectory of AV2 relative to AV1 is an ellipse and compute the lengths of its semi-axes. Hint: what is the general form of the equation of an axis-aligned ellipse centered in the origin? | . | 📨 Deliverable 5 - More properties of quaternions (5 pts) . In the lecture notes, we have defined two linear maps $ Omega_1: mathbb{R}^4 rightarrow mathbb{R}^{4 times 4}$, and $ Omega_2: mathbb{R}^4 rightarrow mathbb{R}^{4 times 4}$, such that for any $q in mathbb{R}^4$, we have: [ Omega_1(q) = begin{bmatrix} q_4 &amp; -q_3 &amp; q_2 &amp; q_1 q_3 &amp; q_4 &amp; -q_1 &amp; q_2 -q_2 &amp; q_1 &amp; q_4 &amp; q_3 -q_1 &amp; -q_2 &amp; -q_3 &amp; q_4 end{bmatrix}, Omega_2(q) = begin{bmatrix} q_4 &amp; q_3 &amp; -q_2 &amp; q_1 -q_3 &amp; q_4 &amp; q_1 &amp; q_2 q_2 &amp; -q_1 &amp; q_4 &amp; q_3 -q_1 &amp; -q_2 &amp; -q_3 &amp; q_4 end{bmatrix}. ] The product between any two unit quaternions can then be explicitly computed as: [ q_a otimes q_b = Omega_1(q_a) q_b = Omega_2(q_b)q_a. ] In fact, the two linear maps $ Omega_1$ and $ Omega_2$ have more interesting properties, and you are asked to prove the following equalities: . For any unit quaternion $q$, both $ Omega_1(q)$ and $ Omega_2(q)$ are orthogonal matrices, i.e., [ Omega_1(q)^T Omega_1(q) = Omega_1(q) Omega_1(q)^T = I_4, ] [ Omega_2(q)^T Omega_2(q) = Omega_2(q) Omega_2(q)^T = I_4. ] Intuitively, what is the reason that both $ Omega_1(q)$ and $ Omega_2(q)$ must be orthogonal? Hint: what does $q_a otimes q_b$ still being a unit quaternion imply? | . | For any unit quaternion $q$, both $ Omega_1(q)$ and $ Omega_2(q)$ convert $q$ to be the unit quaternion that corresponds to the 3D identity rotation, i.e., [ Omega_1(q)^Tq = Omega_2(q)^Tq = [0,0,0,1]^T. ] . | For any two vectors $x,y in mathbb{R}^4$, show the two linear operators commute, i.e., [ Omega_1(x) Omega_2(y) = Omega_2(y) Omega_1(x), ] [ Omega_1(x) Omega_2(y)^T = Omega_2(y)^T Omega_1(x). ] | 📨 [Optional] Deliverable 6 - Intrinsic vs Extrinsic rotations (20 pts) . Consider the following sequence of rotations: . $R_0$: 90° around $x$ | $R_1$: 180° around $y$ | $R_2$ -30° around $x$ | . A) Extrinsic . The sequence of rotations is applied with respect to a fixed frame of reference (the world frame), as follows: . . Note: the body axes are unlabeled, but represented in red ($x_b$), green ($y_b$), blue ($z_b$) . B) Intrinsic . The sequence of rotations is applied in reverse order with respect to a frame of reference attached to the object (the body frame), as follows: . . Note that the final orientation of the object is the same in both cases! . This property is quite general: it holds regardless of the specific axes and angles of the rotations and for any number of rotations in the sequence. . Could you prove this formally? .",

Getting started with ROS | Installing ROS Setup repositories | Installation | Environment setup | Dependencies for building packages | Initialization | | Getting started with ROS . The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a crucial middleware (a.k.a. collection of software packages) that enables roboticists all over the world to implement their algorithms in a clean and modular fashion and share their work effectively with the community. . In addition, it is at the very core of our class, so we’d better start playing with it! . Installing ROS . By now, you should have a working (preferably fresh) install of Ubuntu 18.04 and have become accustomed with the basics of Linux, Git and C++. The most efficient way to install ros is through the Debian (binary) packages. . To install ROS Melodic on it, we will follow the official guide to install the Desktop-Full Install option. . Setup repositories . Let’s add the packages.ros.org repository to our system . sudo sh -c &#39;echo &quot;deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main&quot; &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list&#39; . and setup the keys . sudo apt-key adv --keyserver &#39;hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80&#39; --recv-key C1CF6E31E6BADE8868B172B4F42ED6FBAB17C654 . Installation . Before installing ROS we need to update the apt index . sudo apt update . Now let’s install ROS 🤖 . sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full . Note: if you encounter the following problem when running the command line above: . Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree Reading state information... Done Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have requested an impossible situation or if you are using the unstable distribution that some required packages have not yet been created or been moved out of Incoming. The following information may help to resolve the situation: The following packages have unmet dependencies: ros-melodic-desktop-full : Depends: ros-melodic-perception but it is not going to be installed E: Unable to correct problems, you have held broken packages. . Then a solution is to instead of running sudo apt install ros-melodic-desktop-full, perform the following: . sudo apt install aptitude sudo aptitude install ros-melodic-desktop-full . Environment setup . It’s convenient if the ROS environment variables are automatically loaded as soon a new shell is launched, let’s edit ~/.bashrc to do so . echo &quot;source /opt/ros/melodic/setup.bash&quot; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc source ~/.bashrc . Dependencies for building packages . Up to now you have installed what you need to run the core ROS packages. To create and manage your own ROS workspaces, there are various tools and requirements that are distributed separately. For example, rosinstall is a frequently used command-line tool that enables you to easily download many source trees for ROS packages with one command. . To install this tool and other dependencies for building ROS packages, run: . sudo apt install python-rosdep python-rosinstall python-rosinstall-generator python-wstool build-essential python-catkin-tools rosbash . Initialization . Before using ROS, we need to initialize rosdep. . sudo rosdep init rosdep update .",

Inside a package we can find the package manifest file, which contains information about the package, author, license, dependencies, compilation flags, and so on. The package.xml file inside the ROS package is the manifest file of that package. . The ROS messages are a type of information that is sent from one ROS process to the other. They are regular text files with .msg extension that define the fields of the messages. . The ROS service is a kind of request/reply interaction between processes. The reply and request data types can be defined inside the srv folder inside the package. . For example, the package we will develop in this lab will be like . . └── two_drones_pkg ├── CMakeLists.txt ├── README.md ├── config │   └── default.rviz ├── launch │   └── two_drones.launch ├── mesh │   └── quadrotor.dae ├── package.xml └── src ├── frames_publisher_node.cpp └── plots_publisher_node.cpp . The workspace . In general terms, the workspace is a folder which contains packages, those packages contain our source files and the environment or workspace provides us with a way to compile those packages. It is useful when we want to compile various packages at the same time and it is a good way of centralizing all of our developments. . ROS Master, nodes and topics . One of the primary purposes of ROS is to facilitate communication between the ROS modules called nodes. Those nodes can be executed on a single machine or across several machines, obtaining a distributed system. The advantage of this structure is that each node can control one aspect of a system. For example you might have several nodes each be responsible of parsing row data from sensors and one node to process them. . ROS Master . Communication between nodes is established by the ROS Master. The ROS Master provides naming and registration services to the nodes in the ROS system. It is its job to track publishers and subscribers to the topics. . ROS master works much like a DNS server. Whenever any node starts in the ROS system, it will start looking for ROS master and register the name of the node with ROS master. Therefore, ROS master has information about all the nodes that are currently running on the ROS system. When information about any node changes, it will generate a call back and update with the latest information. . . ROS Master distributes the information about the topics to the nodes. Before a node can publish to a topic, it sends the details of the topic, such as its name and data type, to ROS master. ROS master will check whether any other nodes are subscribed to the same topic. If any nodes are subscribed to the same topic, ROS master will share the node details of the publisher to the subscriber node. . After receiving the node details, these two nodes will interconnect using the TCPROS protocol, which is based on TCP/IP sockets, and ROS master will relinquish its role in controlling them. . To start ROS master, open a terminal and run . roscore . Any ROS system must have only one master, even in a distributed system, and it should run on a computer that is reachable by all other computers to ensure that remote ROS nodes can access the master. . ROS nodes . Basically, nodes are regular processes but with the capability to register with the ROS Master node and communicate with other nodes in the system. The ROS design idea is that each node is an independent module that interacts with other nodes using the ROS communication capability. . The nodes can be created in various ways. From a terminal window a node can be created directly by typing a command after the command prompt, as shown in the examples to follow. Alternatively, nodes can be created as part of a program written in Python or C++. In this lab, we will use both the ROS commands in a terminal window and Python programs to create nodes. . As example let’s run the turtlesim node, in a new terminal run . rosrun turtlesim turtlesim_node . Yous should see something like . . Now, you can ask the ROS master about the running nodes with . $ rosnode list /rosout /turtlesim . Now, let’s run another node . rosrun turtlesim turtle_teleop_key . Now the list of node changed . $ rosnode list /rosout /teleop_turtle /turtlesim . ROS topics . Topics are the means used by nodes to transmit data, it represents the channel where messages are sent and it has a message type attached to it (you cannot send different types of messages in a topic). In ROS, data production and consumption are decoupled, this means that a node can publish message (producer) or subscribe to a topic (consumer). . Let’s use rqt_graph which shows the nodes and topics currently running. . rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph . If you select Nodes/Topics (all) from the top left and deselect Debug you will see something similar to . . In the graph the ellipses are nodes and the squares are topics. From the picture it’s easy to see that teleop_turtle is publishing to /turtle1/cmd_vel topic. The node /turtlesim is subscribed to the topic and uses the incoming messages to move the turtle. . You can also print the messages to the terminal. Try tu run rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel and move the turtle, you should get something like . $ rostopic echo /turtle1/cmd_vel linear: x: 0.0 y: 0.0 z: 0.0 angular: x: 0.0 y: 0.0 z: -2.0 . These are very useful tools to debug your nodes. . Anatomy of a ROS node . The simplest C++ ROS node has a structure similar to the following . #include &quot;ros/ros.h&quot; int main(int argc, char **argv) { ros::init(argc, argv, &quot;example_node&quot;); ros::NodeHandle n; ros::Rate loop_rate(50); while (ros::ok()) { // ... do some useful things ... ros::spinOnce(); loop_rate.sleep(); } return 0; } . Let’s analyze it line by line: the first line . #include &quot;ros/ros.h&quot; . adds the header containing all the basic ROS functionality. At the beginning of the main of the program . ros::init(argc, argv, &quot;example_node&quot;); . ros::init initialize the node, it is responsible for collecting ROS specific information from arguments passed at the command line and set the node name (remember: names must be unique across the ROS system). But it does not contact the master. To contact the master and register the node we need to call . ros::NodeHandle n; . When the first ros::NodeHandle is created it will call ros::start(), and when the last ros::NodeHandle is destroyed (e.g. goes out of scope), it will call ros::shutdown(). This is the most common way of handling the lifetime of a ROS node. . Usually we want to run our node at a given frequency, to set the node frequency we use . ros::Rate loop_rate(50); . which is setting the desired rate at 50 Hz. Than we have the main loop of the node. Since we want to run this node until the ROS we need to the check the various states of shutdown. The most common way to do it is to call ros::ok(). Once ros::ok() returns false, the node has finished shutting down. That’s why we have . while (ros::ok()) { // ... } . Inside the loop we can make interesting things happen. In our example we simply run . ros::spinOnce(); loop_rate.sleep(); . The function ros::spinOnce() will call all the callbacks waiting to be called at that point in time while. If you remember we set the node frequency to 50Hz, the code we are running will probably take less than 20ms. The function loop_rate.sleep() will pause the node the remaining time. . Launch files . Launch files are the preferred way to run ROS nodes. The launch files provide a convenient interface to execute multiple nodes and a master (if is not already running), as well as other initialization requirements such as parameters. . Usually the launch files are located in the launch folder of the package and have .launch extension. If the package provide one you can use roslaunch to use it. . roslaunch &lt;package_name&gt; &lt;launch_file&gt; . Note: Pushing CTRL+c in a terminal with a launch file running will close all nodes that were started with that launch files. . An example of launch file is . &lt;launch&gt; &lt;node name=&quot;map_server&quot; pkg=&quot;map_server&quot; type=&quot;mapserver&quot; /&gt; &lt;node name=&quot;stageros&quot; pkg=&quot;stage&quot; type=&quot;stageros&quot; args=&quot;$(find navigation_stage)/stage config/worlds/willow-pr2-5cm.world&quot; &gt; &lt;param name=&quot;base_watchdog_timeout&quot; value=&quot;0.2&quot;/&gt; &lt;/node&gt; &lt;include file=&quot;$(find navigation_stage)/move_base_config/amcl_node.xml&quot;/&gt; &lt;/launch&gt; . This example will run three nodes (plus the master if not already running), each &lt;node&gt;...&lt;/node&gt; is equivalent to a rosrun call, for example . &lt;node name=&quot;stageros&quot; pkg=&quot;stage&quot; type=&quot;stageros&quot; args=&quot;$(find navigation_stage)/stage_config/worlds/willow-pr2-5cm.world&quot; /&gt; . is equivalent to . rosrun stage stageros &lt;path-to-navigation-stage-package&gt;/stage_config/worlds/willow-pr2-5cm.world . This tool gives the possibility to add complex and dynamic runtime behavior such as $(find path), unless and if or include other launch files. . Transforms (tf package) . The ROS tf library has been developed to provide a standard method to keep track of coordinate frames and transform data within the entire system so that users can be confident about the consistency of their data in a particular coordinate frame without requiring knowledge about all the other coordinate frames in the system and their associations. . tf is distributed across nodes (across machines too, eventually) and there are two types of tf nodes . Listener: that listen to /tf and cache all data that it collected (up to cache limit) | Broadcaster: that publish transforms between coordinate frames on /tf | . In tf, transforms and coordinate frames are represented as a graph with the transforms as edges and the coordinate frames as nodes. The advantage of this representation is that the relative pose between two nodes is simply the product of the edges connecting the two nodes. A tree structure has also the benefit of allowing for dynamic changes easily. tf indeed takes care of ambiguity of transforms not allowing loops in the transforms graph. . Where to learn TF. . The best resource to learn TF out there is the official ROS tf tutorials. . Take your time to familiarize with the Listener/Broadcaster code, you&#39;ll need for the exercises. . Of course do not forget the official documentation. . Quick overview of tf tools . Let’s see the tools we have to explore the tf tree. . ROS provides a simple demo we are going to use, from a terminal run . roslaunch turtle_tf turtle_tf_demo.launch . Once the turtlesim demo is started, we will drive the center turtle around in turtlesim using the keyboard arrow keys. We can observe that one turtle will continuously follow the turtle we are driving. In this demo application, the ROS TF library is used to create three coordinate frames: a world frame, a turtle1 frame, and a turtle2 frame, and to create a TF broadcaster to publish the coordinate frames of the first turtle and a TF listener to compute the difference between the first and follower turtle frames, as well as drive the second turtle to follow the first. . Using view_frames . The view_frames tool creates a diagram of the frames being broadcast by TF over ROS: . rosrun tf view_frames evince frames.pdf . . Here, you can see that three frames are broadcast by TF—the world, turtle1, and turtle2, where the world frame is the parent of the turtle1 and turtle2 frames. . Using rqt_tf_tree . The rqt_tf_tree tool enables the real-time visualization of the tree of frames being broadcast over ROS . rosrun rqt_tf_tree rqt_tf_tree . . Using tf_echo . The tf_echo tool reports the transformation between any two frames broadcast over ROS . rosrun tf tf_echo [reference_frame] [target_frame] . For example . $ rosrun tf tf_echo turtle1 turtle2 At time 1568050753.324 - Translation: [0.000, 0.000, 0.000] - Rotation: in Quaternion [0.000, 0.000, 0.344, 0.939] in RPY (radian) [0.000, -0.000, 0.703] in RPY (degree) [0.000, -0.000, 40.275] . Usign RViz . RViz is a graphical 3D visualization tool that is useful for viewing the association between TF frames within the ROS system: . . You can run RViz just running . rviz . One it is started, you need to press the button Add to add the TF in the visualization and set the correct Fixed Frame (i.e. world). . Additional resources . Of course there are many details we haven’t discussed here, below you can find resources we find interesting .

Modern filesystems are organized in folders, being able to navigate the filesystem is fundamental. Everytime we work with the shell we are within one folder, to know where we are we can use the command pwd (Print Working Directory): . $ pwd /home/username/vnav2020/lab1 . where username is the login username you set. . ls . To list the contents of the current directory (files and/or child directories, etc.) we use ls (LiSt) . $ ls ex0.cpp ex1.cpp ex2.cpp final.cpp . File permissions and ownership . The concept of permissions and ownership is crucial in anu unix system. Every to file and directory is assigned 3 types of owner: . User: is the owner of the file, by default, the person who created a file | Group: user-group can contain multiple users, all users belonging to a group will have the same access permissions to the file | Other: Any other user who has access to a file | . At the same time to every file and directory is assigned a type of permission . Read | Write | Execute | . We get all this information using ls -l, for example: . $ ls -l total 1112 -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 557042 Aug 24 21:57 dante.txt -rwxr-xr-x 1 username staff 40 Aug 23 18:36 hello.sh -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 171 Aug 23 18:28 hello_vnav2020.tar.gz -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 49 Aug 24 22:55 numbers.txt . The permissions are specified by the 1st field, the ownership is specified by the 3rd and 4th fields. Fo example, the file hello.sh is owned by me (username) and the group is staff. THe permission string is -rwxr-xr-x meaning that: . The owner can read (r), write (w) and execute (x) the file | The group can read and execute | Other can read and execute | . cd . To change the current folder we can use cd (Change Directory). For example cd / moves to the file system root or . cd /home . To move to the parent of the current folder we use cd .., it can also be concatenated like cd ../.. to move two (or more) levels up. To move back to your home folder we use cd ~ (or simply cd). . find . Image you have a folder containing many files and you want to locate a file called findme.txt. To accomplish it you can use . find . -name &quot;findme.txt&quot; . Let’s analyze the command. The . represent the current folder, so we are saying to find to look in the current folder recursively (you can change it with relative or absolute paths) for a file called findme.txt. Find is a powerful tool, you can have complex expression to match files, have a look at find --help. . Edit Filesystem . mkdir . mkdir (make directory) is used to create new, empty directories: let’s create a new dir named newdir . $ mkdir newdir $ ls newdir $ cd newdir . touch . touch was created to modify file timestamps, but it can also be used to quickly create an empty file. You can easily create a newfile.txt with . $ touch newfile.txt $ ls newfile.txt . rm . You can remove any file with rm – be careful, this is non-recoverable! I suggest to add the flag -i to prompt a confirmation message . rm -i newfile.txt rm: remove regular empty file &#39;newfile.txt&#39;? y . You can also remove directories with rm, the only catch is that it returns an error when the folder is not-empty. The common practice, but pretty prone to non-recoverable errors, is to run rm -rf foldername. The command will remove the folder with all its content (r - recursive) forcing the operation (f - force). This operation will not ask for confirmation. You can of course add the flag i (i.e. rm -rfi foldername) but will ask confirmation for every file, this is pretty annoying if the folder contains many files. . cp . Copying file is as simple as running cp (CoPy). If we want to duplicate the file numbers.txt we can run . $ cp numbers.txt numbers_copy.txt $ls numbers.txt numbers_copy.txt . mv . If we want to rename numbers_copy.txt to new_numbers.txt we can run . $ mv numbers_copy.txt new_numbers.txt $ ls new_numbers.txt numbers.txt . With the same command we can also move the file to another location, for example if we want to move numbers.txt to a newly create folder dataset we execute . $ mkdir dataset $ mv numbers.txt dataset/numbers.txt $ ls dataset numbers.txt . Viewing and Editing Files . cat . cat concatenates a list of files and sends them to the standard output stream and is often used to quickly view the content of a file. For example we can inspect the content of the file numbers.txt. . $ cat numbers.txt One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten . nano and vim . nano is a minimalistic command-line text editor. It’s a great editor for beginners. More demanding user pefer vim. It’s a powerful and highly customizable text editor (I love it!). I strongly suggest to learn how to use vim, one of the best way to learn vim is to simply run vimtutor in your terminal but if you prefer games try Vim Adventures! . Download, uncompress and execute a script . In this section we will download a compressed file, extract the content, inspect and run a script. . Download . Imagine you have to download (you have to, actually) http://www.mit.edu/~username/hello_vnav19.tar.gz you can use wget. . wget http://www.mit.edu/~username/hello_vnav19.tar.gz . Uncompress . As you see it is a compressed file, to uncompress it we can use tar . tar -xvf hello_vnav2020.tar.gz . The flags xvf are respectively extract, verbose file. Now we would like to run the script. We should first inspect the file (never run a script without inspection), let’s use cat . $ cat hello.sh #!/usr/bin/env bash echo &quot;Hello world!&quot; . The file is not dangerous, it only print something to the terminal. . Run . Before running the script we should verify that we can actually run the script so let’s see its permissions . $ ls -l hello.sh -rw-r--r-- 1 username staff 40 Aug 23 18:36 hello.sh . Ops! This time we have no right to run the script, we have to add it: . chmod +x hello.sh . Let’s check again: . ls -l hello.sh -rwxr-xr-x 1 username staff 40 Aug 23 18:36 hello.sh . Ok, now we can execute the script. To execute the script it’s enough to add ./ before the name of the file to e . $ ./hello.sh Hello world! . Keep in mind. . When you use ./ the bash shell is creating a new shell, child of the current one and executing the code there. This is usually fine, sometimes you need to run a script like it was prompted directly in the current bash, in that case you should use the source command, e.g. source hello.sh . Pipe . The Pipe is a command in Linux that lets you use two or more commands such that output of one command serves as input to the next. In short, the output of each process directly as input to the next one like a pipeline. The symbol | denotes a pipe. . For example, consider the following file: . $ cat numbers.txt One Two Three Four Five Six Seven Eight Nine Ten . We can sort the lines piping cat with sort . $ cat numbers.txt | sort Eight Five Four Nine One Seven Six Ten Three Two . Output redirect . We redirect the output of a command to a file. This is useful when we want to save the output of a program without writing specific code. . The common commands that we use and their results are . command &gt; output.txt | . The standard output stream will be redirected to the file only, it will not be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten. . command &amp;&gt; output.txt | . Both the standard output and standard error stream will be redirected to the file only, nothing will be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten. . command | tee output.txt | . The standard output stream will be copied to the file, it will still be visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten. . command |&amp; tee output.txt | . Both the standard output and standard error streams will be copied to the file while still being visible in the terminal. If the file already exists, it gets overwritten. . Moreover. . If you want to append instead of overwrite you can use the double angle brackets &gt;&gt;. With tee instead add the flag -a (e.g. tee -a output.txt). . Superuser . Working with the terminal you wil, sooner or later, get a “Permission denied” error. This occur because you do not have the right permission to run the command. . For example if you try install vim you might get something like . $ apt install sl E: Could not open lock file /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (13: Permission denied) E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), are you root? . The superuser (usually “root”) is the only person who can install software, to install vim we must elevate ourself to system administrator . The command we need to use is sudo . $ sudo apt install sl [sudo] password for username: Reading package lists... Done Building dependency tree Reading state information... Done The following NEW packages will be installed: sl 0 upgraded, 1 newly installed, 0 to remove and 2 not upgraded. Need to get 26.4 kB of archives.

Processing triggers for man-db (2.8.3-2ubuntu0.1) ... . Install packages . Ubuntu, like any other Linux distribution based on Debian, use the dpkg packaging system. A packaging system is a way to provide programs and applications for installation. This way, we don’t have to build every program from the source. . APT (Advanced Package Tool) is the command line tool to interact with the packaging system. Installing a package that is available on one of the repository known by the system is as easy as running . sudo apt install &lt;package_1&gt; &lt;package_2&gt; &lt;package_3&gt; . For example if we want to install the package sl we would simply run . sudo apt install sl . Try to run sl now! . Get help . It’s hard remember all commands with all their flags, man command in Linux is used to display the user manual of any command that we can run on the terminal. . Moreover many commands offer an help (for example try to run ls --help). The common ways to summon the help is via the flags -h or --help. . Last but not least, Google is your friend! .",
